INPUT VALUES

pmx.0 concentration is micrograms per m^3 of particles with diameter x.0 micrometers or less 
this device reads pm1.0, 2.5, 10.0
and also concentrations per 0.1L 
for diameter bins  >= 0.3, >= 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 micrometers
the latter looks to have higher-resolution output in adafruit's code

previously I incorrectly thought these units were volume/m^3 but confirmed they are micrograms in the tech details on the product page given above
see that same site for device resolutions and error margins

gives both standard and environmental concentration units. unclear on the difference. see this post

which suggests std is the one to use but the difference might not matter at household-level concentrations


STANDARDS

many outdoor standards
unclear whether these apply to indoor, but so far the answer seems to be yes.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates#Regulation


WHO says standard can be applied to indoor air quality
see par 1 on p10 for discussion and p9 for standards

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

difference between 'environmental' and 'standard' concentrations for pm?

federal aq index calculator (outdoor?): https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-calculator/

do i need to calibrate this thing?

WEB APPLICATION
built a simple sqlite db to store data from the logger. startup_aq.py is the main entry point. can be used to start up web
server and/or the logger. 

/ is the main page
/data is API endpoint for data
/stop is endpoint for stopping the logger if already running

from a data perspective the main difference here is that I've added a location column to the DB
which can be used to differentiate different runs beyond just timestamp
